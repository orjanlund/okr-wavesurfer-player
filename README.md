# okr-wavesurfer-player
Unstyled Wavesurfer.js media player for Nextjs 13

The playFromSeconds state variable is used by external components to control where to play track from.
When "playFromSeconds" is set to a number other than 0 and the trig function is run,
the Player will start playing the loaded track from {playFromSeconds} seconds.
Player needs at least an audio URL "audioLink" to run.
